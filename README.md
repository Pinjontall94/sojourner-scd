# FM-61 SOJOURNER
Sojourner is a FM (technically phase modulation) synthesizer. In this first iteration, it is
written in Supercollider. Most FM synths sit firmly in the camps of extreme minimalism or maximalism; 
Sojourner aims to strike the balance that various 106 and 60-style synths have done for subtractive 
synthesis. In other words:

_FM-61 strives to be the 106 of FM_

## Installation
Clone the repository and open in supercollider. Load regions in order, top to bottom:
1. Server
2. Synths
3. Routing

At this point, FM-1 is live and can be played with MIDI and/or the performance section
